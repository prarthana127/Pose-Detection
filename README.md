# Pose Detection with Machine Learning

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a pose detection system using machine learning models. It leverages the MediaPipe library to identify and analyze human body landmarks in real-time.

## Summary

- *Objective*: To detect human poses and visualize body landmarks for applications like posture correction, fitness tracking, or gesture recognition.
- *Models/Tools Used*:
  - *MediaPipe Pose*: Pre-trained deep learning model for detecting 33 key body landmarks.
  - *OpenCV*: For video frame processing and visualization.
  - *Matplotlib*: For visualizing static results.
- *Key Features*:
  - Real-time detection of body landmarks (e.g., shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles).
  - Visual overlay of body landmarks and skeletons on video frames.
- *Potential Applications*:
  - Fitness tracking
  - Augmented reality (AR/VR)
  - Healthcare and posture correction

## Workflow

1. *Preprocessing*:
   - Captures video input from a webcam or file.
2. *Pose Detection*:
   - Uses MediaPipe to detect and annotate body landmarks.
3. *Visualization*:
   - Displays real-time video frames with annotated body landmarks andÂ connections.
